        //Dictionary

        //jdk 23-> Advanced collection classes that we can use
        //1.collection(GGF)-> Interface(store vales)->List,Set,Queue->why these three?
        //a.List,Set,Queue-different how they store the values
        //List-> Achana,Ashwini,ac,Ashwni-> i want to keep the duplicates
        //Set->Remove the duplicates
        //Queue->FIFO
